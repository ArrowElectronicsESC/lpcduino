# LPCduino
Soure code for LPCduino v0.2

*Finally*, Arduino is here for the LPC family!

This is an initial stage of development for Arduino-like environment for the LPC family, this source has it for the LPC812.

We have implemented the following environment with the aid of the following sources:

1. [Build Your Own Arduino Like Board For Just a Few Dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PMj8LfR2m8)
2. [Adafruit's LPC810 CodeBase](https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC810_CodeBase)

Essentially, the hardware components needed for this are found in the number 1, but here you can find them listed:

1. [USB to Serial FTDI](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B00IJXZQ7C?tag=aamx88-20&keywords=fdti&geniuslink=true)
2. [PCB Adapters](https://www.amazon.com.mx/piezas-7value-placa-TSSOP-SOT23/dp/B09P174D5X/ref=sr_1_1?geniuslink=true&keywords=SOP+to+DIP&qid=1653582388&sr=8-1)
3. [LPC812M101JDH20FP](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/NXP-Semiconductors/LPC812M101JDH20FP?qs=WQO6Kzcwo2GnIeUM20H1Mw%3D%3D)
4. LEDs, resistors and pushbuttons (for debugging and testing purposes)
